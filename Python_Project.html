                        <p>In this scraped i have used BeautifulSoup4(BS4)whcih is a framework that is built into Python. 
                            BS4 is great frame that allows user to grab content from the web and store that content. 
                            For the base of this project used BS4 for grab text based content from the engineeringnz.org 
                            and cleaned and stored the content into rows and coloumns in a table format the use of Python's Pandas. 
                            This project was conduct with a group of 4 people and i was in charge of scraping the content.

                            <p>For the purpose of the Data Exploration and Regression Analysis, I have chosen to work with Air Quality in Italy Dataset the UCI Machine Learning Repository have provided the dataset. 
                                The quality of the air is assessed by using five different type of metal oxide chemical embedded in an Air Quality Chemical Multisensory Device. 
                                These devices have placed in areas where there is significant amount of pollution throughout the cites of Italy. 
                                The data that is stored in the spreadsheet has been collected from March 2004 to February 2005.
